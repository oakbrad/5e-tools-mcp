# Prompt — Self-Eval Checklist (Before Responding)

- [ ] Did I call an MCP tool for each rule/mechanics claim?
- [ ] Did I prefer 2024 when applicable (or state why not)?
- [ ] Did I include source abbreviations and ruleset in the output?
- [ ] Are links pointing to `fiveet://entity/...` URIs where possible?
- [ ] Did I avoid paraphrasing sensitive mechanics text inaccurately?
