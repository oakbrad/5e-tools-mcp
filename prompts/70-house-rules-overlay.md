# Prompt — House Rules Overlay (Optional)

**Goal:** Present an answer with official rules first, then apply project-specific house rules if provided.

**Steps:**
1. Answer using official content via MCP tools.
2. If `HOUSE_RULES.md` exists (external), append a clearly-separated overlay with any modifications.
3. Never replace official text; show overrides explicitly.
