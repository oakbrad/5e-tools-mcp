# Search & Ranking
- Use `search_entities` for all discovery; it fuzzy-ranks by name, slug, and aliases.
- Apply filters:
  - `kinds`: narrow the domain (e.g., `["spell","monster"]`).
  - `ruleset`: `"2024"` for modern rules.
  - `sources`: if you need a specific source (e.g., `["xPHB","PHB"]`).

# When to Re-Query
- If the top-1 is wrong domain/source, re-run `search_entities` with tightened filters.
- For comparisons or lists, request `limit` high enough (10–20) and then fetch details with `get_entity`.
